## SQL Data Exploratory Project
A SQL Server exploratory analysis script for a retail sales dataset using a star schema (fact table + dimension tables).
It walks through the full analytics process:

Exploring database structure using INFORMATION_SCHEMA views.

Profiling dimension tables to understand categories, customer demographics, and product attributes.

Analyzing date ranges, customer ages, and overall temporal coverage.

Computing business-level metrics such as total sales, order counts, average price, quantities sold, and distinct customers/products.

Generating a consolidated KPI report.

Performing magnitude analysis by country, gender, category, and customer revenue contribution.

Running ranking analysis to identify top and bottom performing products and highest-value customers.

The script serves as a complete walkthrough for understanding the dataset, validating data quality, and producing foundational business insights before building dashboards or advanced models.
